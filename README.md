👋 Hi, I’m Pooja Prajapat

👀 I’m interested in:
Full Stack Development, Front-End Engineering, UI/UX Design, and building scalable, high-performance web applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Spring Boot Microservices, Advanced Java (Multithreading, Collections), and improving my front-end skills with modern JavaScript (ES6+).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
Real-world web applications, reusable UI component libraries, Java-based backend projects, and open-source contributions.
